## Hi there 👋

Cybersecurity engineer building security tools, AI experiments, and home lab projects.

### Projects

**[npx-ray](https://github.com/txdadlab/npx-ray)** — npm package security scanner that audits source code, detects obfuscation, and flags supply chain risks before you install. Static analysis, entropy detection, secret scanning, typosquatting checks, and risk scoring — all local, no external APIs.

**[prompt-injection-lab](https://github.com/txdadlab/prompt-injection-lab)** — CTF-style web app for practicing prompt injection attacks against a local LLM. 7 challenge levels with progressively stronger defenses.

**[IP-Reputation-Checker](https://github.com/txdadlab/IP-Reputation-Checker)** — Python tool for querying IP reputation across AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, and IPQualityScore APIs.

**[Simple-LSTM-AI-Model-Pytorch](https://github.com/txdadlab/Simple-LSTM-AI-Model-Pytorch)** — LSTM sentiment classifier built with PyTorch, exploring deep learning for NLP.
