## Hi there 👋

Cybersecurity engineer by day, tinkering with AI and home lab projects after hours.
Just getting started here — plan to keep publishing security tools, AI experiments, and whatever home automation integrations I end up building. More repos on the way.
What's here so far

IP-Reputation-Checker — Python tool for querying IP reputation across AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, and IPQualityScore APIs

Simple-LSTM-AI-Model-Pytorch — LSTM sentiment classifier built with PyTorch, exploring deep learning for NLP

Prompt-Injection-Lab — CTF-style web app for practicing prompt injection attacks against a local LLM, with 7 challenge levels and progressively stronger defenses
